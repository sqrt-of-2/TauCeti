# Reduction classes of integral lattices

For a finitely generated torsion-free abelian group with a distributive monoid action, the
lattice defect in characteristic `ℓ` is its reduction class. Consequently an equivariant
inclusion with finite cokernel preserves that class. This comparison uses exact Grothendieck
classes: the reduced representations need not be isomorphic.

The proofs use the additive lattice defect and its vanishing on finite modules, together with
the fact that quotienting by `ℓ` before extending scalars to characteristic `ℓ` does not change
the resulting representation. Clearing denominators using
`TauCeti.exists_injective_finite_quotient_range_of_nonempty_equiv` then shows that integral
lattices with isomorphic rationalizations have the same reduction class over every field.
In characteristic zero the two maps supplied by
`Representation.Equiv.exists_intertwiningMap_comp_eq_smul` become inverse after dividing by
their nonzero integer scalar.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.latticeDefect_eq_reductionK0_of_subsingleton_torsionBy`: when the scalar torsion is
  trivial, the defect equals the reduction class.
* `TauCeti.reductionK0_eq_of_injective_of_finite_quotient_range`: finite-index inclusions preserve
  reduction classes in prime characteristic.
* `TauCeti.reductionK0_eq_of_nonempty_equiv_baseChange_rat`: isomorphic rationalizations give
  equal reduction classes over every field.
