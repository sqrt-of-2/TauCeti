# Extensions of a projective pro-`p` group split

Let `G` be a projective pro-`p` group: every continuous homomorphism from `G` into a quotient of
a profinite pro-`p` group lifts continuously (`TauCeti.IsProjective`). An extension
`1 → M → E → G → 1` of topological groups with profinite total group `E` and pro-`p` kernel `M`
has pro-`p` total group, so projectivity lifts the identity of `G` through the projection `E ↠ G`
to a continuous homomorphic section: the extension splits
(`GroupExtension.exists_splitting_continuous_of_isProjective`). Only the Hausdorff topological
group structure of `G` enters; profiniteness of `G` is not needed.

Read through the classification of profinite extensions by continuous `H²`, the splitting is the
vanishing of `H²(G, M)` for every profinite pro-`p` abelian `G`-module `M`, proved in
`TauCeti.Topology.Algebra.Group.Profinite.EmbeddingProblem.Cohomology`. The free pro-`p` groups,
on a type or on a pointed profinite space, are projective, and the splitting of their extensions
in `TauCeti.Topology.Algebra.Group.Profinite.Free.Extension` is the instance of this statement at
`freeProP p X`.

## Main results

* `GroupExtension.exists_splitting_continuous_of_isProjective`: every profinite extension of a
  projective pro-`p` group by a pro-`p` group splits by a continuous homomorphic section.

/-- **Extensions of a projective pro-`p` group by a pro-`p` group split.** An extension
`1 → M → E → G → 1` of topological groups with profinite total group and pro-`p` kernel, over a
projective pro-`p` Hausdorff group `G`, has a continuous homomorphic section: the total group is
pro-`p`, and projectivity lifts the identity of `G` through the projection. -/
