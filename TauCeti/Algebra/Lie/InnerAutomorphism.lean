# The inner automorphisms `exp (ad x)`

If `x` is an element of a Lie algebra `L` whose adjoint action `ad x` is nilpotent, then over a
base in which the factorials are invertible the finite sum `exp (ad x) = ∑ (i !)⁻¹ • (ad x)ⁱ` is an
automorphism of `L`. These are the generators of the group `Int L` of inner automorphisms, and they
are the Lie-algebra shadow of the root subgroups of a Chevalley group: for a root vector `e` of a
split semisimple Lie algebra, `exp (ad e)` is the adjoint action of `x_α(1)`.

For an element `x` of an associative `ℚ`-algebra, this shadow is identified with the actual
conjugation action of the nilpotent exponential:

```text
exp (ad x) y = exp(x) y exp(-x).
```

As an application, if `[x, y] = z` and `z` commutes with both `x` and `y`, then

```text
exp(x) exp(y) = exp(y) exp(z) exp(x).
```

This is the central-commutator case of the Chevalley commutator formula. It is the relation for an
`A₂` pair of root vectors and is also a building block for the longer rank-two formulas.

Mathlib already exponentiates a nilpotent *derivation* (`LieDerivation.exp`) and knows that a root
vector is `ad`-nilpotent (`LieAlgebra.isNilpotent_ad_of_mem_rootSpace`). This file specialises the
first to the inner derivations `LieAlgebra.ad K L x` and records the truncations of the
exponential series that a hand computation needs: `TauCeti.expAd_apply_of_lie_eq_zero`,
`TauCeti.expAd_apply_of_lie_lie_eq_zero` and `TauCeti.expAd_apply_of_lie_lie_lie_eq_zero` evaluate
`exp (ad x)` on a vector killed by one, two or three brackets with `x`, which is every case that
occurs inside an `sl₂` triple.

## The `ℚ`-structure hypothesis

The exponential needs to divide by factorials, so `L` must be a `ℚ`-module. Following
`LieDerivation.exp`, this is carried by an unbundled `[LieAlgebra ℚ L]` hypothesis alongside the
base ring `K`. No compatibility between the two actions is assumed, and none is needed: an additive
group carries at most one `ℚ`-module structure, so the hypothesis names a structure rather than
choosing one (`Subsingleton (LieAlgebra ℚ L)`, in `Mathlib/Algebra/Lie/Basic.lean`). Where a
computation does mix the two scalar actions it goes through the `ℕ`-action that both refine, using
`Nat.cast_smul_eq_nsmul`. Whenever `K` is itself a `ℚ`-algebra — in particular whenever it is a
field of characteristic zero — such a structure exists: `TauCeti.ratLieAlgebra` builds it by
restricting scalars along `algebraMap ℚ K`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ratLieAlgebra`: the `ℚ`-Lie-algebra structure on a Lie algebra over a `ℚ`-algebra.
* `TauCeti.expAd`: the inner automorphism `exp (ad x)` of an `ad`-nilpotent element `x`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.expAd_apply_eq_sum`: `exp (ad x)` is the truncated exponential series, truncated at any
  length that already annihilates the vector it is applied to.
* `TauCeti.expAd_apply_of_lie_eq_zero`, `TauCeti.expAd_apply_of_lie_lie_eq_zero`,
  `TauCeti.expAd_apply_of_lie_lie_lie_eq_zero`: the resulting one-, two- and three-term formulas.
* `TauCeti.expAd_apply_self`: `exp (ad x)` fixes `x`.
* `TauCeti.expAd_apply_eq_exp_mul_exp_neg`: on an associative algebra, `exp (ad x)` is
  conjugation by `exp x`.
* `TauCeti.exp_mul_exp_eq_exp_mul_exp_mul_of_lie_eq_of_commute`: the exponential relation for a
  central commutator.
